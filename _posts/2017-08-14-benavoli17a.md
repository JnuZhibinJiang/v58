abstract: "We develop a theory of quantum rational decision making in the tradition
  of\r Anscombe and Aumannâ€™s axiomatisation of preferences on horse lotteries.\r It
  is essentially the Bayesian decision theory generalised to\r the space of Hermitian
  matrices. Among other things, this leads us to give\r a representation theorem showing
  that quantum complete rational preferences\r are obtained by means of expected utility
  considerations."
