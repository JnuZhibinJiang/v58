title: Hindsight Bias Impedes Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the NIPS 2016 Workshop on Imperfect Decision Makers
year: '2016'
abstract: "We propose a model that addresses an open question\r in the cognitive science
  literature: How can we rigorously model\r the cognitive bias known as hindsight
  bias such that\r we fully account for critical experimental results?\r Though hindsight
  bias has been studied extensively,\r prior work has failed to produce a consensus
  theoretical model\r sufficiently general to account for several key experimental
  results,\r or to fully demonstrate how hindsight impedes our ability to learn\r
  the truth in a repeated decision or social network setting.  We\r present a model
  in which agents aim to learn the quality of\r their signals through repeated interactions
  with their environment.\r Our results indicate that agents who are subject to hindsight\r
  bias will always believe themselves to be high-type “expert” regardless\r of whether
  they are actually high- or low-type."
