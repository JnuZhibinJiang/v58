abstract: "Developing theories of when and why simple predictive models\r perform
  well is a key step in understanding decisions of cognitively\r bounded humans and
  intelligent machines. We are interested in\r how well simple models predict in regression.
  We list and review\r existing simple regression models and define new ones. We identify\r
  the lack of a large-scale empirical comparison of these models with\r state-of-the-art
  regression models in a predictive regression context.\r We report the results of
  such an empirical analysis on 60 real-world data\r sets. Simple regression models
  such as equal-weights regression routinely\r outperformed state-of-the-art regression
  models, especially on small training-set sizes.\r There was no simple model that
  predicted well in all data sets, but in nearly\r all data sets, there was at least
  one simple model that predicted well.\r The supplementary material contains learning
  curves for individual data sets that have\r not been presented in the main article.
  It also contains detailed descriptions and source\r descriptions of all used data
  sets.\r "
