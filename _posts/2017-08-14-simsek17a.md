abstract: "Decision heuristics are simple models of human and animal decision making\r
  that use few pieces of information and combine the pieces in simple ways, for example,\r
  by giving them equal weight or by considering them sequentially. We examine how
  decision\r heuristics can be learned—and modified—as additional training examples
  become available.\r In particular, we examine how additional training examples change
  the variance in parameter\r estimates of the heuristic. Our analysis suggests new
  decision heuristics, including\r a family of heuristics that generalizes two well-known
  families: lexicographic heuristics\r and tallying. We evaluate the empirical performance
  of these heuristics\r in a large, diverse collection of data sets.\r The supplementary
  material provides details on the random\r forest implementation and describes the
  56 public data sets used in the empirical analysis.\r "
