abstract: "Simple decision heuristics are cognitive models of human and animal decision\r
  making. They examine few pieces of information and combine the pieces in\r simple
  ways, for example, by considering them sequentially or giving them\r equal weight.
  They have been studied most extensively for the problem of\r \\textitcomparison,
  where the objective is to identify which of a given\r number of alternatives has
  the highest value on a specified (unobserved)\r criterion. We present the most comprehensive
  empirical evaluation of decision\r heuristics to date on the comparison problem.
  In a diverse collection of 56\r real-world data sets, we compared heuristics to
  powerful statistical learning\r methods, including support vector machines and random
  forests. Heuristics\r performed surprisingly well. On average, they were only a
  few percentage\r points behind the best-performing algorithm. In many data sets,
  they yielded\r the highest accuracy in all or parts of the learning curve.\r The
  first part of the supplement describes implementation details of the\r algorithms
  tested; the second part describes the 56 public data sets used in\r the empirical
  analysis. "
