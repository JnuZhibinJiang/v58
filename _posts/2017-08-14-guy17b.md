abstract: "The ultimatum game serves for studying various aspects of decision making\r
  (DM). Recently, its multi-proposer version has been modified to study the influence\r
  of deliberation costs. An optimising policy of the responder, switching between
  several\r proposers at non-negligible deliberation costs, was designed and successfully
  tested\r in a simulated environment. The policy design was done within the  framework
  of\r Markov Decision Processes with rewards also allowing to model the responder’s
  feeling\r for fairness. It relies on simple Markov models of proposers, which are
  recursively\r learnt in a Bayesian way during the game course. This paper verifies,
  whether the\r gained theoretically plausible policy, suits to real-life DM. It describes
  experiments\r in which this policy was applied against human proposers. The results
  – with eleven\r groups of three independently acting proposers – confirm the soundness
  of this policy.\r It increases the responder’s economic profit due to switching
  between proposers, in spite\r of the deliberation costs and the used approximate
  modelling of proposers. Methodologically,\r it opens the possibility to learn systematically
  willingness of humans to spent their\r deliberation resources on specific DM tasks."
