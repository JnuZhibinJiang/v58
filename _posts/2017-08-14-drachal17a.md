title: Forecasting Spot Oil Price Using Google Probabilities
booktitle: Proceedings of the NIPS 2016 Workshop on Imperfect Decision Makers
year: '2016'
abstract: "In this paper DMA (Dynamic Averaging Model) is expanded by adding certain
  probabilities\r based on Google Trends. Such a method is applied to forecasting
  spot oil prices (WTI).\r In particular it is checked whether a dynamic model including
  stock prices in\r developed markets, stock prices in China, stock prices volatility,
  exchange rates,\r global economic activity, interest rates, production, consumption,
  import and level of\r inventories as independent variables might be improved by
  including a certain measure\r of Google searches. Monthly data between 2004 and
  2015 were analysed. It was found that such a\r modification leads to slightly better
  forecast. However, the weight ascribed to Google\r searches should  be quite small.
  Except that it was found that even unmodified DMA produced\r better forecast than
  that based on futures contracts or naive forecast."
