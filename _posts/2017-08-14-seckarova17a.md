title: Performance of Kullback-Leibler Based Expert Opinion Pooling for Unlikely Events
booktitle: Proceedings of the NIPS 2016 Workshop on Imperfect Decision Makers

abstract: "The aggregation of available information\r is of great importance in many
  branches of economics, social sciences. Often,\r we can only rely on experts’ opinions,
  i.e. probabilities assigned to\r possible events. To deal with opinions in probabilistic
  form, we focus on the\r Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence based pools: linear, logarithmic
  and\r KL-pool. Since occurrence of events is subject to random influences of the\r
  real world, it is important to address events assigned lower probabilities\r (unlikely
  events). This is done by choosing pooling with a higher entropy\r than standard
  linear or logarithmic options, i.e. the KL-pool. We show how\r well the mentioned
  pools perform on real data using absolute error,\r KL-divergence and quadratic reward.
  In cases favoring events assigned higher\r probabilities, the KL-pool performs similarly
  to the linear pool and\r outperforms the logarithmic pool. When unlikely events
  occur, the KL-pool\r outperforms both pools, which makes it a reasonable way of
  pooling."
