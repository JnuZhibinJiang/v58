abstract: "In many settings people must give numerical scores to\r entities from a
  small discrete set. For instance, rating physical\r attractiveness from 1–5 on dating
  sites, or papers from 1–10\r for conference reviewing. We study the problem of understanding\r
  when using a different number of options is optimal. For concreteness\r we assume
  the true underlying scores are integers from 1–100.\r We consider the case when
  scores are uniform random and Gaussian.\r While in theory for this setting it would
  be optimal to use all 100\r options, in practice this is prohibitive, and it is
  preferable to\r utilize a smaller number of options due to humans’ cognitive limitations.\r
  Our results suggest that using a smaller number of options than is typical\r could
  be optimal in certain situations. This would have many potential\r applications,
  as settings requiring entities to be ranked by humans are ubiquitous."
