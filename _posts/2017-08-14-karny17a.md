abstract: "The need for inspecting (ir)rationality in decision making (DM)\r — the
  observed discrepancy between real and prescriptive DMs —\r stems from omnipresence
  of DM in individuals’ and society life.\r Active approaches try to diminish this
  discrepancy either by changing\r behaviour of participants (DM subjects) or modifying
  prescriptive\r theories as done in this text. It provides a core of unified merging\r
  methodology of probabilities serving for knowledge fusion and information\r sharing
  exploited in cooperative DM.  Specifically, it unifies merging\r methodologies supporting
  a flat cooperation of interacting self-interested\r DM participants. They act without
  a facilitator and they are unwilling\r to spare a non-negligible deliberation effort
  on merging. They are supposed\r to solve their DM tasks via the fully probabilistic
  design (FPD) of\r decision strategies. This option is motivated by the fact that
  FPD\r is axiomatically justified and extends standard Bayesian DM.\r Merging is
  a supporting DM task and is also solved  via FPD.\r The proposed merging formulation
  tries to be as general as possible\r without entering into technicalities of measure
  theory. The results generalise\r and unify earlier work and open a pathway to systematic
  solutions of\r specific, less general,  problems."
