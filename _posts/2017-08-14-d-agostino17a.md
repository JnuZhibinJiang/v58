title: Rational Beliefs Real Agents Can Have – A Logical Point of View
booktitle: Proceedings of the NIPS 2016 Workshop on Imperfect Decision Makers
year: '2016'
abstract: "The purpose of this note is to outline a framework for uncertain\r reasoning
  which  drops unrealistic assumptions about the agents’\r inferential  capabilities.
  To do so, we envisage a pivotal role for\r the recent research programme of \\emphdepth-bounded
  Boolean logics.\r We suggest that this can be fruitfully extended to the representation\r
  of rational belief  under uncertainty. By doing this we lay the\r foundations for
  a prescriptive account of rational belief, namely one\r that  \\emphrealistic agents,
  as opposed to   idealised ones, can feasibly act upon."
