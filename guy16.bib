{Simple decision heuristics are cognitive models of human and animal decision
making. They examine few pieces of information and combine the pieces in
simple ways, for example, by considering them sequentially or giving them
equal weight. They have been studied most extensively for the problem of
\textit{comparison,} where the objective is to identify which of a given
number of alternatives has the highest value on a specified (unobserved)
criterion. We present the most comprehensive empirical evaluation of decision
heuristics to date on the comparison problem. In a diverse collection of 56
real-world data sets, we compared heuristics to powerful statistical learning
methods, including support vector machines and random forests. Heuristics
performed surprisingly well. On average, they were only a few percentage
points behind the best-performing algorithm. In many data sets, they yielded
the highest accuracy in all or parts of the learning curve.

The first part of the supplement describes implementation details of the
algorithms tested; the second part describes the 56 public data sets used in
the empirical analysis. }}

     outperformed state-of-the-art regression models, especially on small training-set sizes.
      There was no simple model that predicted well in all data sets, but in nearly
      all data sets, there was at least one simple model that predicted well.

    abstract = {The need for inspecting (ir)rationality in decision making (DM)
           --- the observed discrepancy between real and prescriptive DMs ---
           stems from omnipresence of DM in individuals' and society life.
           Active approaches try to diminish this discrepancy either by changing
           behaviour of participants (DM subjects) or modifying prescriptive
           theories as done in this text. It provides a core of unified merging
           methodology of probabilities serving for knowledge fusion and information
           sharing exploited in cooperative DM.  Specifically, it unifies merging
           methodologies supporting a flat cooperation of interacting self-interested
           DM participants. They act without a facilitator and they are unwilling
           to spare a non-negligible deliberation effort on merging. They are supposed
           to solve their DM tasks via the fully probabilistic design (FPD) of
           decision strategies. This option is motivated by the fact that FPD
           is axiomatically justified and extends standard Bayesian DM.
           Merging is a supporting DM task and is also solved  via FPD.
           The proposed merging formulation tries to be as general as possible
           without entering into technicalities of measure theory. The results generalise
           and unify earlier work and open a pathway to systematic solutions of
           specific, less general,  problems.}}

is of great importance in many branches of economics, social sciences. Often,
we can only rely on experts' opinions, i.e. probabilities assigned to
possible events. To deal with opinions in probabilistic form, we focus on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence based pools: linear, logarithmic and
KL-pool. Since occurrence of events is subject to random influences of the
real world, it is important to address events assigned lower probabilities
(unlikely events). This is done by choosing pooling with a higher entropy
than standard linear or logarithmic options, i.e. the KL-pool. We show how
well the mentioned pools perform on real data using absolute error,
KL-divergence and quadratic reward. In cases favoring events assigned higher
probabilities, the KL-pool performs similarly to the linear pool and
outperforms the logarithmic pool. When unlikely events occur, the KL-pool
outperforms both pools, which makes it a reasonable way of pooling.}}

    abstract = {The ultimatum game serves for studying various aspects of decision making
      (DM). Recently, its multi-proposer version has been modified to study the influence
      of deliberation costs. An optimising policy of the responder, switching between several
       proposers at non-negligible deliberation costs, was designed and successfully tested
       in a simulated environment. The policy design was done within the  framework of
       Markov Decision Processes with rewards also allowing to model the responder's feeling
       for fairness. It relies on simple Markov models of proposers, which are recursively
       learnt in a Bayesian way during the game course. This paper verifies, whether the
       gained theoretically plausible policy, suits to real-life DM. It describes experiments
       in which this policy was applied against human proposers. The results -- with eleven
       groups of three independently acting proposers -- confirm the soundness of this policy.
       It increases the responder's economic profit due to switching between proposers, in spite
       of the deliberation costs and the used approximate modelling of proposers. Methodologically,
       it opens the possibility to learn systematically willingness of humans to spent their
       deliberation resources on specific DM tasks.}}

     when using a different number of options is optimal. For concreteness
     we assume the true underlying scores are integers from 1--100.
     We consider the case when scores are uniform random and Gaussian.
     While in theory for this setting it would be optimal to use all 100
     options, in practice this is prohibitive, and it is preferable to
     utilize a smaller number of options due to humans' cognitive limitations.
     Our results suggest that using a smaller number of options than is typical
     could be optimal in certain situations. This would have many potential
     applications, as settings requiring entities to be ranked by humans are ubiquitous.}}
